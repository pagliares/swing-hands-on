# Swing hands-on

Welcome to the repository containing examples used in the Java Desktop Development with Swing classes taught by Rodrigo Martins Pagliares in the Computer Science undergraduate course at UNIFAL-MG, Brazil. 

I thinnk this repository is a valuable resource for students who want to review class examples or further explore Swing development. I hope you find it helpful and informative!

<strong> summary </strong>

This example creates a basic GUI window using the Swing framework. It is organized into a single class called PrimeiraJanela, which contains a single method called main().

The main() method is the entry point of the program and is the first method to be executed when the program is run. It creates a new JFrame object and sets its title to "Primeira janela" using the constructor.

Next, it sets the size of the window using the setSize() method, which takes two arguments: the width and height of the window in pixels. In this case, the width is set to 300 pixels and the height is set to 250 pixels.

Finally, the program sets the visibility of the window to true using the setVisible() method, which shows the window on the screen.

In summary, this code creates a basic Swing GUI window with a specified size and title and makes it visible on the screen. It's a simple but essential starting point for creating more complex GUI applications in Java.
